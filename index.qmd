# Introduction

This document describes the processes and methods to assess and evaluate student outcomes in the BYU Civil Engineering program. ABET criterion 4 states: 

> The program must regularly use appropriate, documented processes for assessing and evaluating the extent to which the student outcomes are being attained. The results of these evaluations must be systematically utilized as input for the program's continuous improvement actions. Other available information may also be used to assist in the continuous improvement of the program.

This manual documents these processes and provides a record of historical assessment data. 
The program uses three categories of assessments:

  1. Direct assessment of student outcomes in course assignment (see @sec-so)
  2. Graduation surveys and exit interviews (see @sec-exit)
  3. The share of participating students who pass the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (FE) (see @sec-fe)

## Improvement Actions
Each summer, the CE undergraduate committee evaluates recent assessment data and recommends actions to adjust one or more of the following:

  - program courses, requirements, or prerequisites
  - course content or activities
  - assessments or evaluations
  - performance indicators or associated rubrics
  
The undergraduate committee documents specific actions in meeting notes stored
in the department Teams folder as well as through formal program change
applications with the University Registrar. When recommending changes to courses
or course activities, the program committee works closely with the course
instructors to design and implement the proposed actions.

Individual instructors make improvements to course activities, pedagogy, and content based
on data obtained through direct experience and student evaluation comments. These
are important data that may lead to recommended course and program changes, but are not a
formal assessment tool.
