## Exit Interviews {#sec-interview}

Each April, the undergraduate committee samples graduating seniors and interviews them in personal conversation. The purpose of this interview is to qualitatively assess student-observed program strengths and weakness.

The CE undergraduate coordinator assigns three to four graduating seniors to each member of the committee. The committee members arrange to speak privately with each student for fifteen to twenty minutes. The student should be invited to direct the discussion, but possible questions include: 

  - What are the most positive learning experiences you have had?
  - Have you had any less successful learning experiences?
