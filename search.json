When recommending changes to courses or course activities, the program committee works closely with the course instructors to design and implement the proposed actions.\nIndividual instructors make improvements to course activities, pedagogy, and content based on data obtained through direct experience and student evaluation comments. These are important data that may lead to recommended course and program changes, but are not a formal assessment tool.",
