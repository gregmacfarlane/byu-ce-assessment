When recommending changes to courses or course activities, the program committee works closely with the course instructors to design and implement the proposed actions.\nIndividual instructors make improvements to course activities, pedagogy, and content based on data obtained through direct experience and student evaluation comments. These are important data that may lead to recommended course and program changes, but are not a formal assessment tool.",

Students should:\n\nRecognize personal and professional responsibilities towards others including employees, clients, the wider profession, and the public.\nRecognize moral and ethical dilemmas in engineering situations and make judgments to identify appropriate resolutions.\nConsider the impacts of an engineering solution in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.\n\n\n\nRubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nUnsatisfactory\nDeveloping\nMeets Expectations\nExceeds expectations\n\n\n\n\nRecognize responsibilities\nDoes not recognize or identify professional responsibilities.\nRecognizes some professional responsibilities, but misses at least one.\nRecognizes professional responsibilities towards all key stakeholders\nDemonstrates interest in and motivation to serve society through the profession.\n\n\nMake judgments\nDoes not identify ethical dilemmas, and or develops inappropriate resolutions\nMisidentifies ethical dilemmas, and or develops inadequate resolutions.\nProperly identifies ethical dilemmas and identifies appropriate resolutions.\nActively considers ethical challenges that may arise in professional contexts and seeks to mitigate them.\n\n\nConsider impacts\nFails to identify impacts in any contexts.\nIdentifies impacts in some contexts, but fails to identify likely impacts in others.\nIdentifies likely impacts in a variety of contexts.\nActively seeks to consider the ethical impact of engineering situations in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment\nWe assess this learning outcome in three courses:\n\nCCE 102: Sustainable Infrastructure (Introductory)\nCE 291 R: Civil Engineering Seminar (Reinforcing)\nCE 472: Civil Engineering Capstone (Evaluation)\n\nWe evaluated this outcome most recently in Winter 2025. All graduating students take CE 472 in Winter semester. Students take CE 291 R each semester from their sophomore year onward. CCE 102 may be taken in Fall or Winter semesters, so this is approximately a 50% sample of the students in the program. CCE 102 also includes students who are in the CFM and the FM programs.\nFigure 2.1 shows the share of students at each performance level for each indicator for each course, alongside the threshold of 75%. By taking CE 472, 75% of students meet the expectations for each indicator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Winter 2025 Assessment of Student Outcome 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.\n\nPerformance Indicators\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\n\nAn ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions\n\nPerformance Indicators\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\n\nAn ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.​\n\nPerformance Indicators\n\n\nAssessment",
