# Fundamentals of Engineering {#sec-fe}

The Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination provides important external
evidence of our program's effectiveness in training competent civil engineering
professionals. University policies prohibit us from requiring students to take
the exam before graduation, but we strongly recommend that our students do so
and offer an FE preparation course to help them.

We obtain the number of graduates who take and pass the exam each year directly
from NCEES.
